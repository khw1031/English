#### Technical Problem Escalation
```
Subject: URGENT - Production Database Performance Issue

Hi [Manager],

I'm escalating a critical performance issue we're experiencing:

Problem Summary:
- Database query response times increased by 300% since yesterday
- Affecting user authentication and data retrieval
- Current impact: ~1000 users experiencing delays

Root Cause Analysis:
- Initial investigation points to index corruption
- Database logs show unusual locking patterns
- Memory usage spiked to 95% during peak hours

Immediate Actions Taken:
- Implemented query optimization workarounds
- Added database monitoring alerts
- Prepared rollback plan to previous stable version

Recommended Solution:
- Schedule maintenance window for index rebuilding
- Upgrade database server memory
- Implement connection pooling optimization

I'll keep you updated every 30 minutes until resolved.

Thanks,
[Your name]
