This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a personal English learning management system for a Korean developer (TOEIC 890) targeting professional fluency for international tech companies. The repository follows a structured 3-phase approach over 6-12 months with systematic vocabulary building and work-integrated learning.

## Repository Structure

- **`user-plan.md`**: Master learning plan with 3-phase structure, daily schedules, vocabulary targets, and communication templates
- **`daily-learning/`**: Daily progress tracking, practice logs, and learning records
- **`vocabularies/`**: Vocabulary lists, word tracking, and spaced repetition management
- **Learning Philosophy**: Systematic, analytical approach converting intuitive knowledge to explicit rules

## Learning Architecture

### Phase Structure
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-3)**: Foundation building, 20+ hours/week, 500+ vocabulary words
- **Phase 2 (Months 4-6)**: Practical application, 15 hours/week, 800+ vocabulary words  
- **Phase 3 (Months 7-12)**: Professional mastery, 10 hours/week, 500+ expert vocabulary

### Core Learning Areas
1. **Technical English**: Data structures, algorithms, development, architecture
2. **Business Communication**: Meetings, projects, collaboration, problem-solving
3. **Daily Conversation**: Greetings, opinions, clarification, agreement/disagreement
4. **Work Integration**: English code comments, commits, documentation, reviews

## Content Organization Patterns

### Daily Learning Files
- Daily progress logs with vocabulary count, conversation practice, technical writing
- Speaking practice records and meeting simulation notes
- Technical writing exercises and code review practice

### Vocabulary Management
- Phase-specific word lists organized by category (technical/business/daily/cultural)
- Spaced repetition tracking and usage examples
- Industry-specific terminology and pronunciation guides

### Communication Templates
- Business email templates (status updates, problem escalation)

- Meeting participation frameworks (technical discussions, problem-solving)

## Key Success Metrics

- **Vocabulary Mastery**: 10 words/day, categorized by phase and application area
- **Communication Practice**: 3 English interactions daily, meeting contributions
- **Technical Integration**: English documentation, code reviews, GitHub contributions
- **Professional Development**: Presentations, client communication, mentoring capabilities
